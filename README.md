# gaussian_and_binomial_dist


Summary of the package
This package is used to calculated the Gaussian or Normal Distribution.

i.e. gaussian(10, 2). The first number would be the mean, and the 2 would be the standard deviation.

Based off of that we can use Binomial distribution using. 

Binomial(.4, 25) where .4 is the percentage and 25 is the amount.



#  Files


Explanation of files in the package

We have the Generaldistribution.py file used to create the Distribution class, with mean mu, and standard deviation sigma. This file also has the method to read  the file for sample. 

Gaussian distribution calculates the Gaussian Distribution

Binomialdistribution calculates the Binomial Distribution.
